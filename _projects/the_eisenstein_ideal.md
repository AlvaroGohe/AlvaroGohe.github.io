I gave this talk on the 7th of December of 2022 for the study group on Mazur's torsion theorem organised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pedrocazorlagarcia">Pedro José Cazorla García</a> and <a href="https://ed-galilee.univ-paris13.fr/lucas-lagarde/">Lucas Lagarde</a>.

The goal of the study group was to understand Mazur's famous theorem on the classification of all possible torsion groups that an elliptic curve can have over the rationals. In this talk, I discussed one of the final steps of the proof that there cannot be rational torsion points of prime order greater than $$7$$.

These are the slides of my talk:
