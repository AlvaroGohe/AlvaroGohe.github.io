I gave this talk at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/juniornumbertheory2425/home">London Junior Number Theory Seminar</a> on the 20th of May 2025. Some of the topics I talked about are similar to those in my talk <a href="https://alvarogohe.github.io/projects/crazy_for_three/">Crazy for three: K3 quotients of abelian surfaces by a group of order three in characteristic three</a>.

After the talk, we watched the film The French Dispatch (which I would honestly recommend over any talk on K3 surfaces).
