I gave this talk in the conference <a href="https://y-rant.github.io/">Young Researchers in Algebraic Number Theory (Y-RANT)</a>, which took place at the University of Oxford.

This talk is based on the last section of my paper **Explicit desingularisation of Kummer surfaces in characteristic two via specialisation** {% cite Gonzalez-Hernandez2024ExplicitDesingularisation %}.
