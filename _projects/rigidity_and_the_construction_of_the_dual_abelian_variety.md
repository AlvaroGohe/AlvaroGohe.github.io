I gave this talk on the 17th of October of 2023 for the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/hubbard/abelianvarsreadinggroup/">study group on abelian varieties</a> organised by <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/hubbard/">David Hubbard</a>.

The goal of the study group was to construct and prove the main properties of abelian varieties. In my talk, I mainly talked about rigidity, which is a property of complete algebraic varieties that, in the case of abelian varieties, allows us to prove that the group law is commutative.

These are the notes I wrote for my talk:
