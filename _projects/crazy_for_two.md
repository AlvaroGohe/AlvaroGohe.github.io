I gave this talk in the conference <a href="https://y-rant.github.io/">Young Researchers in Algebraic Number Theory (Y-RANT)</a> on the 6th of September of 2023, at the University of Cambridge.

This talk is based on the first half of my paper **Explicit desingularisation of Kummer surfaces in characteristic two via specialisation** {% cite Gonzalez-Hernandez2024ExplicitDesingularisation %}.
