I gave this talk in the conference <a href="https://y-rant.github.io/">Queer in Number Theory and Geometry (QuINGs)</a> on the 31st of August of 2023 at West Lexham, Norfolk.

This talk is based on the first half of my paper **Explicit desingularisation of Kummer surfaces in characteristic two via specialisation** {% cite Gonzalez-Hernandez2024ExplicitDesingularisation %}.
