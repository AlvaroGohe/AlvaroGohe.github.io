I gave this talk on the 27th of October of 2023 for the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/lupoian/moduliproblems/">study group on moduli problems of elliptic curves</a> organised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/elviralupoian/home">Elvira Lupoian</a>.

The goal of the study group was to understand the foundations of the arithmetic theory of moduli spaces of elliptic curves. In my talk, I explained the theory of Cartier divisors and how they can be used to define $$\Gamma(n), \Gamma_1(n)$$ and $$\Gamma_0(n)$$-structures on elliptic curves defined over a scheme. These are the notes I wrote for my talk:
