As part of the Festival of Postgraduate Research at the University of Warwick, on the 12th of May of 2025, I gave a three-minute talk explaining what my PhD is about to a general audience. Here is the video:

  <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; max-width: 720px; padding-top: 56.25%;"> <!-- 16:9 aspect ratio -->
    <video

      controls 
      style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border-radius: 8px;"
    >
      <track
