On the 12th of May of 2025, as part of the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/services/dc/phdlife/festival/">Festival of Postgraduate Research</a> at the University of Warwick, I gave a three-minute talk explaining what my PhD is about to a general audience. Here is the video:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; padding: 30px 0;">
  <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; max-width: 720px; padding-top: 56.25%;"> <!-- 16:9 aspect ratio -->
    <video 
      src="/assets/video/How_to_blow_up_video.mp4" 
      controls 
      style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border-radius: 8px;"
    >
      <track
