I gave this talk in the <a href="http://www.rnta.eu/7MSRNTA/sp.html">7th Symposium of the Roman Number Theory Association</a> on the 4th of May of 2023.

This talk is based on the first half of my paper **Explicit desingularisation of Kummer surfaces in characteristic two via specialisation** {% cite Gonzalez-Hernandez2024ExplicitDesingularisation %}.
