I gave this talk when I was an invited speaker in the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/research/events/seminars/areas/postgraduate/21-22/">Mathematics Postgraduate Seminar</a> of the University of Warwick on the 19th of January of 2022.

This talk is based on my master's dissertation **Local fields and the Hasse principle** {% cite Mastersthesis %}.
