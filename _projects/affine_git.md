I gave this talk on the 31st of October of 2024 for the <a href="https://www.marctruter.com/reading-groups">study group on Geometric Invariant Theory</a> organised by <a href="https://www.marctruter.com/home">Marc Truter</a>.

The goal of the study group was to understand the basics of Geometric Invariant Theory following <a href="https://userpage.fu-berlin.de/hoskins/M15_Lecture_notes.pdf">these notes written by Victoria Hoskins</a>. In this talk, I explained what a reductive group $$G$$ was, and how to construct the GIT quotient of an affine variety by the action of $$G$$. These are the notes I wrote:
