I gave this talk on the 2nd of December of 2022 for the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/mocanu/">study group on isogeny-based cryptography</a> organised by <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/mocanu/isocrypt/">Diana Mocanu</a>.

The goal of this study group was to learn the foundations of isogeny-based cryptography and some of its newest developments, such as the key recovery attack schemes on SIDH. In my talk, I presented the construction of the jacobian variety of a hyperelliptic curve and the types of isogenies that are used in higher genus cryptography.

These are the slides for my talk:
