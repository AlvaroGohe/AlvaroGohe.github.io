I gave this talk on the 25th of April of 2022 for the study group on Mazur's torsion theorem organised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pedrocazorlagarcia">Pedro José Cazorla García</a> and <a href="https://ed-galilee.univ-paris13.fr/lucas-lagarde/">Lucas Lagarde</a>.

The goal of the study group was to understand Mazur's famous theorem on the classification of all possible torsion groups that an elliptic curve can have over the rationals. In this talk, I did a simple introduction to the theory of elliptic curves over discrete valuation rings and explained the Néron-Ogg-Shafarevich criterion.

These are the slides of my talk:
