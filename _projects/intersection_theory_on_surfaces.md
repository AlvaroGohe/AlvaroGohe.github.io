I gave this talk on the 20th of May of 2022 for the a <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/naralasantos/hasseweil">study group on Hasse-Weil zeta functions</a> that <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/naralasantos/">Nuno Arala Santos</a> and I organised.

The goal of the study group was to study the proofs of the Weil conjectures for curves and then to get a glimpse of the theory for higher-dimensional varieties. In this talk, I did an introduction to the theory of intersection number of divisors in surfaces.

These are the slides of my talk:
