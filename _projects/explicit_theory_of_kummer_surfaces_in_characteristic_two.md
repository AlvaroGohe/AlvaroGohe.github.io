I have given this talk twice:

<ul>
<li>When I was invited to give a talk in the <a href="https://www.bristolmathsresearch.org/events/linfoot-number-theory/">Linfoot Number Theory</a> of the University of Bristol on the 4th of October of 2023.</li>
<li>When I was invited to give a talk in the <a href="https://hodge.maths.ed.ac.uk/?page_id=38">Hodge Club</a> of the University of Edinburgh on the 9th of February of 2024.</li>
</ul>

This talk is based on the first half of my paper **Explicit desingularisation of Kummer surfaces in characteristic two via specialisation** {% cite Gonzalez-Hernandez2024ExplicitDesingularisation %}.
