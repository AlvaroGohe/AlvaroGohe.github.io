I gave this talk on the 6th of February of 2025 for the <a href="https://www.marctruter.com/reading-groups">study group on K-stability</a> organised by <a href="https://www.marctruter.com/home">Marc Truter</a>.

The goal of the study group was to understand the basics of K-stability following <a href="https://www.math.utah.edu/~blum/KstabilityNotes.pdf">these notes written by Harold Blum</a>. In this talk, I explained two important theorems that Yuji Odaka proved. The first one solves the problem of which Calabi-Yau and canonically polarised varieties are K-stable. The second one shows that K-semistability imposes conditions on the possible singularities of a variety. These are the notes I wrote:
