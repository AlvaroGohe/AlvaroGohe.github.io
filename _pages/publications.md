These are some of the projects that I have written or I am in the process of writing.

Currently, I am studying how to construct projective embeddings for generalised Kummer surfaces, which are K3 surfaces that are quotients of abelian surfaces by an automorphism group. My goal is to use these embeddings to study which singularities we get in these surfaces when the characteristic of the base field divides the order of the automorphism.
