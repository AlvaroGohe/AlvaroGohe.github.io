Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hola! I am a Teaching Fellow at the <a href='https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/'>Mathematics Institute</a> of the University of Warwick, where I am also completing my PhD under the supervision of <a href='https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/damiano_testa/'> Dr Damiano Testa </a> and <a href='https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/brown/'>Professor Gavin Brown</a>.

<!-- I am interested in algebraic geometry and number theory, particularly on the following topics: K3 surfaces and their arithmetic, singularities in positive characteristic, generalised Kummer surfaces, and abelian varieties. If none of these words make sense to you, you can watch <a href="https://alvarogohe.github.io/projects/how_to_blow_up_a_surface"> this three-minute talk</a> where I explain what I do to a general audience. -->

I am interested in algebraic geometry and number theory, particularly on the following topics: 
<ul>
<li> K3 surfaces and their arithmetic.
<li> Singularities in positive characteristic geometry. 
<li> Generalised Kummer surfaces.
<li> Abelian varieties. 
</ul>
If none of these words make sense to you, you can watch <a href="https://alvarogohe.github.io/projects/how_to_blow_up_a_surface"> this three-minute talk</a> where I explain what I do to a general audience.

I studied the MSc in Mathematical Sciences at the University of Oxford and the BSc in Mathematics at the Universidad de Salamanca (Spain). I also spent a year at the University of Edinburgh as an exchange student during my undergraduate degree.

My surname is **Gonzalez Hernandez** (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_naming_customs'>yes, both words are my surname!</a>) but I publish as **Gonzalez-Hernandez** for convenience.

Outside of mathematics, I enjoy graphic design, watching cinema (<a href='https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/22/pedro-almodovar-on-spains-tragic-past-you-cant-ask-people-to-forget'>Pedro Almod√≥var</a> is my favourite director) and doing martial arts (mostly judo and jiu jitsu).
