Hola! I am a fourth year PhD student in algebraic geometry and number theory under the supervision of <a href='https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/brown/'>Professor Gavin Brown </a> and <a href='https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/damiano_testa/'> Dr Damiano Testa </a> at the <a href='https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/'>University of Warwick</a>. Some of the topics that I am interested in are: generalised Kummer surfaces, K3 surfaces and their arithmetic, singularities in positive characteristic, and abelian varieties.

I studied the MSc in Mathematical Sciences at the University of Oxford and the BSc in Mathematics at the Universidad de Salamanca (Spain). I also spent a year in the University of Edinburgh as an exchange student during my undergraduate degree.

My surname is Gonzalez Hernandez (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_naming_customs'>yes, both words are my surname!</a>) but I publish as Gonzalez-Hernandez for convenience.

Outside of mathematics, I enjoy graphic design, watching cinema (<a href='https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/22/pedro-almodovar-on-spains-tragic-past-you-cant-ask-people-to-forget'>Pedro Almodovar</a> is my favourite director) and doing martial arts (mostly judo and jiu jitsu).
