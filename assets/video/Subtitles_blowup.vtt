00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.560
Okay, Alvaro. Yay, brilliant.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.960
So Alvaro's going to talk about how to

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.160
blow up a surface without getting

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.800
arrested.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.920
Let me start with a real world story.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.200
So one of the leading researchers in my

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.440
area of research was in an airport and he

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.560
was talking to a colleague through the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.400
phone. He was like, "I tried

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.440
everything to sort out this problem, but

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.240
there's no other choice. I have to blow

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.840
up a plane". Then, the airport

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.960
security overheard him and immediately

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.840
arrested him. However, after long

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.440
hours of questioning, he was finally

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.800
released. Turns out, he had been talking

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.600
about his research. My name is Alvaro,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.440
and I am a researcher in algebraic

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.320
geometry, which is an area of pure

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.080
mathematics that uses algebra to study

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.040
geometry. More specifically, my area of

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.920
research are surfaces. Surfaces

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.800
are basically the shells of 3D

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.640
objects that we know, such as the sphere,

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.840
the cone, or the cylinder. My job as a

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.320
mathematician is to try to see what these

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.600
things have in common, what these shapes

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.480
have in common, and what allows us to

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.560
tell them apart. So, for instance, let's

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.600
look at an easy case, the sphere and the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.320
cone. The surface of the sphere is quite

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.120
uniform and regular and soft, whereas

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.240
the cone has this pointy bit that if

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.520
we touch it, it pinches us.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.400
So surfaces are quite uniform and

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.720
regular, it's what we know as smooth

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.840
surfaces. Whereas surfaces that have,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.360
you know, punchy bits and rugged

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.680
parts are what we know as singular

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.920
surfaces. And my job as a mathematician

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.000
is to determine how to transform smooth

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.560
surfaces, well, singular surfaces into

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.200
smooth surfaces. A technique that I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.080
use to do this is what is known as a

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.200
blow-up. And this is the technique that

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.360
this researcher was talking about when he

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.160
was arrested. So the main

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.960
idea of it is, imagine that we want to

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.160
transform a cone into a sphere. One thing

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.640
that we could do is, we can imagine that

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.240
the surface of the cone is made out of

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.240
rubber, and it has a hole in the bottom,

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.520
so we can plump a bike pump, and we

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.800
can just inflate the cone until

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.120
somehow the pointy bit just starts

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.000
becoming more and more uniform until it

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.320
resembles the sphere. This is the idea

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.280
behind blow-ups, and this is the idea

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.160
behind my research. What I do is, I

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.600
use computers to study how to

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.040
make very singular surfaces, like the one

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.200
you can see on the screen, into very

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.640
smooth surfaces. And you might be

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.040
wondering, why am I interested in

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.320
something like this? Well, my research has

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.000
applications in many areas. For instance,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.080
many objects in physics, such as black

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.800
holes, are modeled as singularities

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.640
in time and space, for instance. It also

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.080
has applications in 3D modeling, where

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.120
resolving singularities allows us to

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.440
have more accurate and more

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.320
interactive models. So either by

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.200
studying, if we want to study the corners

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.120
of the universe or make our favorite

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.440
characters look better, many of the

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.080
problems in mathematics can be solved

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.400
with a bang. Thank you.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.040
So, literally ended his talk with a bang.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.640
Brilliant. Okay.
