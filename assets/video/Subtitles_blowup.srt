1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,560
Okay, Alvaro. Yay, brilliant.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,960
So Alvaro's going to talk about how to

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,160
blow up a surface without getting

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:10,800
arrested.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,920
Let me start with a real world story.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,200
So one of the leading researchers in my

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,440
area of research was in an airport and he

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,560
was talking to a colleague through the

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,400
phone. He was like, "I tried

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,440
everything to sort out this problem, but

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,240
there's no other choice. I have to blow

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,840
up a plane". Then, the airport

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,960
security overheard him and immediately

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,840
arrested him. However, after long

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,440
hours of questioning, he was finally

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,800
released. Turns out, he had been talking

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,600
about his research. My name is Alvaro,

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,440
and I am a researcher in algebraic

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,320
geometry, which is an area of pure

20
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,080
mathematics that uses algebra to study

21
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,040
geometry. More specifically, my area of

22
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,920
research are surfaces. Surfaces

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,800
are basically the shells of 3D

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,640
objects that we know, such as the sphere,

25
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,840
the cone, or the cylinder. My job as a

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,320
mathematician is to try to see what these

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,600
things have in common, what these shapes

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,480
have in common, and what allows us to

29
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,560
tell them apart. So, for instance, let's

30
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,600
look at an easy case, the sphere and the

31
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,320
cone. The surface of the sphere is quite

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,120
uniform and regular and soft, whereas

33
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,240
the cone has this pointy bit that if

34
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,520
we touch it, it pinches us.

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,400
So surfaces are quite uniform and

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,720
regular, it's what we know as smooth

37
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,840
surfaces. Whereas surfaces that have,

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,360
you know, punchy bits and rugged

39
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,680
parts are what we know as singular

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,920
surfaces. And my job as a mathematician

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,000
is to determine how to transform smooth

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,560
surfaces, well, singular surfaces into

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,200
smooth surfaces. A technique that I

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,080
use to do this is what is known as a

45
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,200
blow-up. And this is the technique that

46
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,360
this researcher was talking about when he

47
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,160
was arrested. So the main

48
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,960
idea of it is, imagine that we want to

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,160
transform a cone into a sphere. One thing

50
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,640
that we could do is, we can imagine that

51
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,240
the surface of the cone is made out of

52
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,240
rubber, and it has a hole in the bottom,

53
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,520
so we can plump a bike pump, and we

54
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,800
can just inflate the cone until

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,120
somehow the pointy bit just starts

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,000
becoming more and more uniform until it

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,320
resembles the sphere. This is the idea

58
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,280
behind blow-ups, and this is the idea

59
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,160
behind my research. What I do is, I

60
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,600
use computers to study how to

61
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,040
make very singular surfaces, like the one

62
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,200
you can see on the screen, into very

63
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,640
smooth surfaces. And you might be

64
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,040
wondering, why am I interested in

65
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,320
something like this? Well, my research has

66
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,000
applications in many areas. For instance,

67
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,080
many objects in physics, such as black

68
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,800
holes, are modeled as singularities

69
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,640
in time and space, for instance. It also

70
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,080
has applications in 3D modeling, where

71
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,120
resolving singularities allows us to

72
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,440
have more accurate and more

73
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,320
interactive models. So either by

74
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,200
studying, if we want to study the corners

75
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,120
of the universe or make our favorite

76
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,440
characters look better, many of the

77
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,080
problems in mathematics can be solved

78
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,400
with a bang. Thank you.

79
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,040
So, literally ended his talk with a bang.

80
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,640
Brilliant. Okay.
