I was fortunate to be able to organise the Number Theory parallel session of the <a style="font-weight:bold" href="https://jovenes2025.rsme.es/index.html">VII Congreso de J칩venes Investigadores de la RSME</a>, which took place in Bilbao from the 13th to the 17th of January. 

Together with <a href="https://www.data-science.ie/user/beatriz+barbero+lucas/">Beatriz Barbero Lucas</a>, <a href="https://danielgilmu.wixsite.com/mathematician">Daniel Gil Mu침oz</a> and Javier Guill치n Rial, we had the chance to gather an amazing selection of speakers representing many different topics in number theory.

I had an amazing time in Bilbao, as we were offered multiple opportunities to attend social activities, including one <a href="https://culturacientifica.com/evento/2025/1/15/bertsomaticas-matematicas-al-son-de-los-bertsos/">mixing the Basque artistic discipline of bertsolarism and math outreach </a>. I have myself learned many things about the Basque culture in this trip. If you want to learn more about number theory and the Basque country, you can do so with the following Kahoot.

I also had the opportunity to give a talk about my outcoming work about the intersection of the Ekedahl-Oort and automorphism strata inside of the moduli space of genus 2 curves.
