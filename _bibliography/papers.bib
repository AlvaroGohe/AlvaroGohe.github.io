                   of their rank by the method of complete 2-descent. The knowledge gained from this theory is then used to analyse a family of counterexamples to the
                   Hasse principle depending on a prime parameter. This family of curves arises as the homogeneous spaces that appear when applying complete 2-descent
                   to an elliptic curve with non-trivial Tate-Shafarevich group.},

  abstract      = {Continued fractions have played an important role in the development of many mathematical theories and, even today, they are still a very active
                   line of research. The study of continued fractions with complex coefficients relies on the analysis of the regions where the continued fraction 
                   converges. This convergence theory allows us to define meromorphic functions as continued fractions from their formal power series with the help
                   of a sequence of rational approximations known as Padé approximants. Furthermore, there is an equivalence between real numbers and simple continued
                   fractions (a special case of continued fractions with integer coefficients) and, based on this equivalence, one can study problems of number theory
                   such as how well irrational numbers can be approximated by rational numbers or how to solve Pell's equation.},
