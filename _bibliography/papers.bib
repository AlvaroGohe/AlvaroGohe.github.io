We first describe explicitly which possible automorphism groups a genus two curve can have over a field of positive characteristic, and parametrise the families of curves with a prescribed automorphism group. Then, we describe an algorithm to compute the strata of genus two curves whose Jacobian variety has a fixed Ekedahl-Oort type. Finally, we compute the dimension and number of irreducible components of the intersections between the strata.},

  abstract = {We study the birational geometry of the Kummer surfaces associated to the Jacobian varieties of genus two curves, with a particular focus on fields of characteristic two. In order to do so, we explicitly compute a projective embedding of the Jacobian of a general genus two curve and, from this, we construct its associated Kummer surface. This explicit construction produces a model for desingularised Kummer surfaces over any field of characteristic not two, and specialising these equations to characteristic two provides a model of a partial desingularisation. Adapting the classic description of the Picard lattice in terms of tropes, we also describe how to explicitly find completely desingularised models of Kummer surfaces whenever the p-rank is not zero. In the final section of this paper, we compute an example of a Kummer surface with everywhere good reduction over a quadratic number field, and draw connections between the models we computed and a criterion that determines when a Kummer surface has good reduction at two.},

                   of a sequence of rational approximations known as Padé approximants. Furthermore, there is an equivalence between real numbers and simple continued
                   fractions (a special case of continued fractions with integer coefficients) and, based on this equivalence, we study problems of number theory
                   such as how well irrational numbers can be approximated by rational numbers or how to solve Pell's equation.},
