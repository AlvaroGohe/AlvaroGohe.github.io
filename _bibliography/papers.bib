  title         = "{Explicit desingularisation of Kummer surfaces in characteristic two via specialisation}",
  author        = {Alvaro Gonzalez-Hernandez},
  abstract      = {We study the birational geometry of the Kummer surfaces associated to the Jacobian varieties of genus two curves, with a particular focus on fields of
                    characteristic two. In order to do so, we explicitly compute a projective embedding of the Jacobian of a general genus two curve and, from this, we
                    construct its associated Kummer surface. This explicit construction produces a model for desingularised Kummer surfaces over any field of characteristic not
                    two, and specialising these equations to characteristic two provides a model of partial desingularisation. Adapting the classic description of the Picard
                    lattice in terms of tropes, we also describe how to explicitly find completely desingularised models of Kummer surfaces whenever the $p$-rank is not zero. In
                    the final section of this paper, we compute an example of a Kummer surface with everywhere good reduction over a quadratic number field, and draw connections
                    between the models we computed and a criterion that determines when a Kummer surface has good reduction at two.},

                   Hasse principle depending on a prime parameter. This family of curves arises as the homogeneous spaces that appear when applying complete 2-descent
                   to an elliptic curve with non-trivial Tate-Shafarevich group.},

  abstract      = {Continued fractions have played an important role in the development of many mathematical theories and, even today, they are still a very active
                   line of research. The study of continued fractions with complex coefficients allows us to define meromorphic functions as continued fractions from their formal power series with the help
                   of a sequence of rational approximations known as Padé approximants. Furthermore, there is an equivalence between real numbers and simple continued
                   fractions (a special case of continued fractions with integer coefficients) and, based on this equivalence, we study problems of number theory
                   such as how well irrational numbers can be approximated by rational numbers or how to solve Pell's equation.},
